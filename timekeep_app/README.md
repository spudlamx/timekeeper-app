# Overview

This is an app to keep time. It keeps track of the time between presses of the button, and shows you the total.

My purpose for creating this app is to have a simple way to keep track of time at work.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: Have it store times on device storage so you can close the app without resetting.
* Item 2: Create a screen to show the times when you clocked in and out.
* Item 3: Create more professional display.
